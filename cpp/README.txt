This is a synthesizer made in c ++

I made this using the tutorial series from OLC and the book "A tour of c ++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is mostly made in visual studio code
only a few minor flaws have been fixed and the .txt files are created in vim.

You can use this code for whatever you want as long as you give OLC credit somewhere.

This program featured Sine waves, Oscillators, envelopes and all the beautiful things you can find in synthesizers.
